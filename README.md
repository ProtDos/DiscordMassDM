## Warning
This didn't get patched at this moment: `8/20/2022`. If it did, please make an issue. Feel free to fork it and make pull requests. 
This is a self bot, so it's against discord TOS. I don't take any responsabilities for any damage. 
It's your choice to download and use the script. 
> I'm not a 12 y/o token scammer, feel free to look into the code.

## Enjoy!
